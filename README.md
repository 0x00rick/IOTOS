# IOTOS
This install script is aimed at quickly setting up a new Debian based OS environment to start with the more fun part of hacking.  
Initially this script was targeted at setting up the OS for IOT debugging & exploitation, but with that some reverse engineering and fuzzing capabilities joined the ranks of the original programs.  

The following tools are getting installed along the way:

* Fully updated system including cross compiling capabilities for mips/arm/ppc and a python2/3 environment.
